            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>And because the glory of God in the propagation of his Gospel, &amp; the winning of souls to Jesus Christ, ought chiefly to be the designe of Christians that fear his Name, and do professe his truth: And it is certain that one singular means of promoting so glorious ends is the countenance and incouragement of a painfull, learned, and godly Ministery: And considering the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160147:3"/>sad condition of many Congregations of this City, who for want of such to break unto them the bread of life, are fain to wander about to other places, as sheep that have no Shepherd; either having lost their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full orthodox Teachers for want of competent main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, or not being able to find any that are willing to take their Charges upon them, by reason of the shortnesse of the means of their subsistance, together with the uncertainty of that which is in being, through the subtill undermining devices of Malignants, and Sectaries, who are continually labouring what in them lyes, to discourage the Ministery by withholding what is due: And being very sencible into what contempt and scorn the Ministery it self is brought through want of an honourable Maintenance according to Christs appointment, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. And withall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding what this Honourable Court hath begun already to act with relation to this blessed work. Therefore (as we cannot but heartily blesse God, who hath graciously put these worthy thoughts into your hearts, so) we are bold humbly to beseech, that (out of the sincere affections, which we are confident you bear to the House of God, and to his truth) you would hasten these good beginnings to full maturity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as they may be ready to receive with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient speed the confirming stamp of Civill Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from both the Honourable Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which undertaking (if God shall honour you to accomplish) will rest undoubtedly as a Crown of glory upon the head of all your other actions, and procure a rich and certain blessing from the God of heaven: <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10. and be a worthy President to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160147:4"/>Kingdom, to the great joy and comfort of all Gods faithfull people, and much redound to the furtherance of his glory.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Honourable House of Commons hath lately put forth a Declaration, expressing their dislike of, and resolution to proceed against such as take upon them to Preach, and expound the Scripture in any publick place, being not ordained, &amp;c We do intreat that this Honourable C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urt will please to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present our thankfull acknowledgements to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable House for these so hopefull beginnings; and further to move the Honourable Houses, that (in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of these pious resolutions) they will please to annex such power by the joynt and mutuall Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them both, as may give the Magistrate incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to suppresse these Mechanick and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Preachers; and inable him for this end to punish their presumption in this kinde for time to come.</p>
            <p>And further, we earnestly do pray, that you will please to certifie our humble desires to the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Houses, for removing that part of the Army without delay which at this present is quartered near the City, as also for a prevention of the like for the future; considering the great scarcity that is like to follow by their so near approach (the inconvenience whereof we do already feel.) And the discontents that may arise among the poorer sort by means thereof, the greatnesse of whose numbers is not to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: As also what other mischiefs may hereby be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as it will appear to be no groundlesse suspicion and fear, if the mutinous and menacing words of some of the Souldery be well weighed.</p>

For which cause in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our duty we humbly pray, that this Honourable Court will please to put forth their Authority for the future suppression of these lying &amp; ungodly Pamphlets; and inflict such punishment upon the wicked contrivers of them, as your Power will reach unto: that the mouthes of lyars may be stopped, and Truth and Innocency may take place.</p>
